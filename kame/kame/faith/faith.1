.Sh NAME
.Nm faith
.Nd
set an IPv6 prefix to be used by the FAITH kernel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm faith
.Op Fl de
.Op Fl p Ar prefix
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
NOTE:
.Nm
is a backward compatibility wrapper for FAITH IPv4-v6 TCP relaying service.
One should migrate to new user interface
.Po
using
.Xr route 8
command
.Pc
for more flexibility and configurability.
.Pp
.Nm
controls FAITH IPv4-v6 TCP relaying service support code in the kernel.
The kernel mechanism will work cooperatively with
.Xr faithd 8 .
.Nm
command is designed to be invoked at host/router
that runs FAITH daemon,
.Xr faithd 8 ,
which provides TCP relaying service to other hosts.
.Pp
.Fl d
and
.Fl e
will disable and enable the FAITH kernel code, respectively.
If enabled, the kernel tosses up TCP segments whose destination matches the 
.Ar prefix.
.Pp
If 
.Fl p Ar prefix
is given, the specified
.Ar prefix
is set to the kernel as address translation prefix.
.Pp
If
.Fl i Ar interface
is given,
.Ar interface
will be used for FAITH translation.
.Ar interface
must be FAITH pseudo interface, i.e.
.Dv faith[0-9] .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
exits with 0 on success, and non-zero on errors.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr faithd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
