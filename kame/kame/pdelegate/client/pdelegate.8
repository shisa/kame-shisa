.Sh NAME
.Nm pdelegate
.Nd prefix delegation client
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dv
.Op Fl l Ar prefixlen
.Ar interface
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
requests an IPv6 prefix to a delegator on
.Ar interface ,
by using ICMPv6 prefix delegation protocol.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
The flag puts the program into the debug mode.
Specifically,
.Fl d
turns off ICMPv6 type-based filter.
.It Fl l Ar prefixlen
.Ar prefixlen
specifies the prefix length to be requested to the delegator.
The default value for
.Ar prefixlen
is 64.
.It Fl v
The flag lets
.Nm
generate more verbose messages to the standard error device.
.El
.\"
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
exits with
.Dv EXIT_SUCCESS
.Pq 0
on successful prefix delegation, and
.Dv EXIT_FAILURE
.Pq 1
on error or timeouts
.Pq like when there is no delegator .

.Sh BUGS
There are numerious assumptions hardcoded into the program, which we should not.
.Pp
There is no official ICMPv6 type assigned for
the ICMPv6 prefix delegation protocol.
The program uses 150 and 151 by default.
.Pp
There is no IPv6 link-local multicast address assigned for the protocol,
for the use during the delegator discovery phase.
The program uses
.Li ff02::2
.Pq all-routers multicast address
for now.
