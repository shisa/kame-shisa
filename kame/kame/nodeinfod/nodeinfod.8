.Nm nodeinfod
.Nd responds to ICMPv6 node information queries

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl df
.Op Fl n Ar name
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
responds to ICMPv6 node information queries.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
will use the result from
.Xr gethostname 3
as the node name
.Pq or FQDN .
With
.Fl n ,
you can specify alternate hostname by an additional argument,
.Ar name .
.Fl f
runs
.Nm
in foreground mode
.Pq do not become daemon .
.Fl d
is for debugging.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
exits with 0 on success, and non-zero on errors.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
At this moment, there is no way for users to suppress node information
responses from the KAME kernel.
Therefore, if you run
.Nm
on KAME kernel, you will see two responses.
.Pp
There are a lot of spec violations.
(1) subject address validation is insufficient,
(2) does not return node name
.Pq FQDN
TTL,
and more.
