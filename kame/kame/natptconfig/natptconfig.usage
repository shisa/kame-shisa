This is simple NAT-PT configuration example.  This shows NAT-PT setup
between inside IPv6 host and outside IPv4 host
Sorry, this example is FreeBSD 4.5 specific.

Sample network is as follows.  As shown in the following figure,
outside interface is "fxp0", inside interface is "ed0".

	(outside)
	------------+---------------- 10.0.69/24
		    |
		    | fxp0 (10.0.69.68)
		 NATPT
		    | ed0 (3ffe:501:041c:6000:0200:2ff:fe00:270c)
		    |
	------------+---------------- 3ffe:0501:041c/48
	(inside)


How to install and use NAT-PT
  - kernel configuration option
      uncomment "options NATPT" of your kernel configuration file.
      % make 
      # make install

  - edit /etc/rc.conf
      add the following varibles in /etc/rc.conf.

	ipv6_enable="YES"
	ipv6_network_interfaces="ed0"
	ipv6_gateway_enable="YES"
	ipv6_prefix_ed0="3ffe:0501:041c:6000"
	rtadvd_enable="YES"
	rtadvd_interfaces="ed0"

     then reboot machine.

  - edit natpt.conf (any name is ok)
      create natpt.conf with the following content.

	prefix natpt 3ffe:0501:041c:c1ad::
	map from any6 to 10.0.69.68 port 28672 - 32767
	map enable

  - apply natpt.conf
      usually natptconfig(8) is installed into /usr/local/v6/sbin.
