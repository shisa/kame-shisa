kame-dhcp6

	kame-dhcp6 is an open-source implementation of Dynamic Host
	Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) developed by the KAME
	project.

	The implementation mainly conforms to the following standards:

	- RFC3315: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
	- RFC3319: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) Options 
         	   for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers
	- RFC3633: IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration
	           Protocol (DHCP)
	- RFC3646: DNS Configuration options for Dynamic Host
	           Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)

	All the components of the main protocol are provided, i.e.,
	DHCPv6 clients, servers, and relay agents.

	Supported message types are as follows:
	  Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, Release, Reply,
	  Information-request, Relay-forward and Relay-reply.

	Note that the current implementation does not support IPv6
	address allocation by DHCPv6, and there is no plan to
	implement that feature at the moment.  The main purpose of
	this implementation is to provide a way of IPv6 prefix
	delegation (RFC3633) and to provide some "stateless"
	configuration information such as DNS recursive server
	addresses.
