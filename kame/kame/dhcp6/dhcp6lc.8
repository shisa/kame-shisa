.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp6lc
.Nd stateless-DHCPv6 client
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s Ar scriptfile
.Op Fl Dd
.Ar interface
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
works as a stateless-DHCPv6 (a.k.a. DHCPv6-lite) client and gets 
information from DHCPv6 servers from the specified
.Ar interface .
.Pp
Once it obtains information from upstream DHCPv6 servers, it terminates
automatically.
.Pp
The command line options are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.\"
.It Fl s Ar scriptfile
Script file to be executed.  See "Configuration Script" of
.Xr dhcp6c 8
for further detail.  If you do not specify this option, 
.Nm
just executes the stateless DHCPv6 protocol handshake and does not
make use of the obtained information.
.It Fl d
Print debugging messages.
.It Fl D
Even more debugging information is printed.
Although
.Nm
usually prints warning, debugging, or error messages to
.Xr syslog 8 ,
it prints the messages to standard error if this option is
specified.
.El
.Pp
.\"
.Sh Script Examples
The followings are a sample script.
With this configuration
.Nm
will send information-request messages to an upstream PPP link,
.Ar ppp0 .
After receiving DNS information from a server,
.Nm
will then execute this script to reflect the information
to /etc/resolv.conf.

.Sh HISTORY
The

command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
.Pp
Some option type values,
including those related to NTP,
are still not officially assigned.
The current implementation uses experimental values,
which may cause interoperability problems with other implementations.
