.Sh NAME
.Nm bgpd.conf
.Nd bgpd configuration file
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/bgpd.conf
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The bgpd config file consists of a sequence of statements terminated
by a semi-colon (`;').
Statements are composed of tokens
separated by white space, which can be any combination of blanks, tabs
and newlines.
This structure simplifies identification of
the parts of the configuration associated with each other and with
specific protocols.
Lines beginning with
.Ql #
are comments.
.\"
.Sh Meta Syntax
Keywords and special characters that the parser expects exactly are
displayed using the
.Ic bold
font.
Parameters are specifying with
.Ar underline .
Parameters shown in
square brackets (`[' and `]') are used to show optional
keywords and parameters.
The vertical bar (`|') is used to indicate
between a choice of optional parameters.
Parentheses (`(' and
`)') are used to group keywords and parameters when necessary.
.\"
.Sh Interface specification
There are some statements that may or have to specify interface.
Interfaces are specified in the form of "name unit", such as
.Ar lo0
and
.Ar ep1.
.\"
.Sh Specifying Log Level
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic log
.Ar option...
.Ic ;
.Xc
Specify debug messages to be printed out.
Each
.Ar option
usually specifies a subset of the messages to be printed.
If an
.Ar option
begins with
.Ic no ,
it means that the set of the messages that are specified by the option
will not be printed.
For example,
.Ic `all norip'
means that all the messages except RIPng related ones will be printed.
Valid options are
.Ic aspath, bgpstate, bgpconnect, bgpinput, bgpoutput, bgproute, bgp,
.Ic interface, inet6, rip, route, filter, timer,
and
.Ic all .
The
.Ic bgp
option means all the BGP related options to be printed.
.El
.\"
.Sh Specifying Dump File
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic dumpfile Ar filename Ic ;
.Xc
Specifies the name of the dump file
(see
.Xr bgpd 8 ) .
.El
.\"
.Sh Specifying Filters
The following four route filters can be specified, each of which
is for a RIPng interface or a BGP peer (see below).
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic filterin Ar prefix Ic ;
Specifies incoming route filtering.
If an incoming route on the
interface or from the peer matches the specified prefix,
it will be ignored and will not be installed in the kernel.
.Pp
The prefixes are specified in the form of
.Ql address/prefix_length,
such as
.Ar 3ffe:509::/32
and
.Ar 3ffe:501:100f::/48.
The special string 
.Ar default
can also be specified as a prefix, which means the default route.
Note that the semantics of
.Ar default
is different from the semantics of
.Ar ::/0 .
The former is to specify filtering the default route (exact match),
but the latter is to specify filtering all routes that match
.Ar ::/0 ,
that is, filtering all incoming routes.
.\"
.It Ic restrictin Ar prefix Ic ;
Specifies incoming route restriction.
An incoming route on the interface or from the peer
will be ignored unless it matches
.Ar prefix .
If this attribute is specified for more than one prefix,
an incoming route will be required to match at least one prefix of them.
Like the
.Ic filterin
attribute, the special string
.Ar default
can be specified as a prefix, which means that all non default routes
will be ignored on the interface or from the peer.
.\"
.It Ic filterout Ar prefix Ic ;
Specifies outgoing route filtering.
If an outgoing route on the
interface or to the peer matches the specified prefix,
it will not be advertised.
The special string
.Ar default
can also be specified for this attribute, which means that the default route
will not be advertised on the interface nor to the peer.
Note that the semantics of
.Ic filterout Ar ::/0
is different from the semantics of
.Ic filterout Ar default .
The former means that all routes that match the prefix
.Ar ::/0
will not be advertised on the interface.
For a RIPng interface, it thus has the same meaning
of the
.Ic noripout .
attribute.
.\"
.It Ic restrictout Ar prefix Ic ;
Specifies outgoing route restriction.
An outgoing route on the interface or to the peer will not be
advertised unless it matches
.Ar prefix .
If this attribute is specified for more than one prefix,
an outgoing route will be required to match at least one prefix of
them.
If the special string
.Ar default
is specified as a prefix, it means that only the default route will be
advertised on the interface nor to the peer.
.El
.\"
.Sh The BGP Related Statements
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic autonomoussystem Ar as_number Ic ;
.Xc
Sets the autonomous system number of this router to be autonomous
system.
This statement is required if BGP is in use.
The AS number is assigned by the Network Information Center (NIC).
.\"
.It Ic bgpsbsize Ar size Ic ;
Sets the size of socket write buffer for each BGP socket.
.\"
.It Ic routerid Ar router_id Ic ;
Sets the router identifier for use by the BGP and OSPF protocols.
The default is the address of the first interface encountered by
.Nm bgpd
except the loopback address(127.0.0.1).
.\"
.It Ic clusterid Ar cluster_id Ic ;
Sets the cluster identifier for use as a BGP route reflector.
The default is the address of the first interface encountered by
.Nm bgpd
except the loopback address(127.0.0.1).
.\"
.It Ic IamRouteReflector ;
Specifies to act as a route reflector.
.\"
.It Ic holdtime Ar seconds Ic ;
Specifies the BGP holdtime value to use when negotiating the
connection with this peer, in seconds.
According to BGP, if bgpd does not receive a keepalive, update, or notification message
within the period specified in the Hold Time field of
the BGP Open message, then the BGP connection will be closed.
The value must be either 0 (no keepalives will be sent)
or at least 3.
The default value is 240 according to the RFC 1771.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic bgp (yes \(ba no) { Ar substatements
.Ic };
.Xc
Enables or disables BGP.
By default BGP is disabled.
The following two substatements can be appeared in the
.Ic bgp
statement.
.\"
.It Ic group type external peeras Ar remote_as_number {
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic peer Ar host
.Op Ic interface Ar interface
.Op Ic preference Ar preference
.Op Ic prepend Op Ar iteration
.Op Ic no synchronization
.Op Ic lcladdr Ar localaddress
.Op Ar filters...
.Ic ;
.Ic };
.Xc
.El
.Pp
Specifies the IPv6 address and AS number of an individual EBGP peer.
The interface on which the peer exists may also be specified.
Interface
specification may be necessary when the peer address is a link-local
address.
If the optional keyword
.Ic preference
is specified followed by a number, bgpd uses the value as the value of
local preference when advertising reachable routes from the peer via
IBGP.
Currently, the value can only be specified per peer base.
If the optional keyword
.Ic prepend
is specified, bgpd adds its AS number to the as path when advertising
reachable routes to other EBGP peers.
This keywords takes an optional argument, which specifies number of iteration
of the addition.
If the argument is omitted, bgpd treats it as 1.
Note that
.Ic prepend 1
makes each advertised AS path longer than usual.
Typically, this keywords does not have to be set.
If the optional keyword
.Ic no synchronization
is specified, bgpd will export each EBGP route to the peer without waiting
for synchronization with RIPng for the route.
The optional keyword
.Ic lcladdr
specifies the local(source) IPv6 address to connect the peer.
If the node has multiple IPv6 addresses that can be used as the source address,
the keyword should be specified.
If a list of
.Ar filters
is specified, each of the
.Ar filters
is applied to the peer according to the semantics of each filter
described above.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic group type internal
.Op Ic routerid Ar router_id
.Ic { Ar substatements
.Ic };
.Xc
Specifies a set of IBGP peers.
The BGP identifier of the peer can be specified with the keyword
.Ic routerid,
but bgpd doesn't use the value for any significant purpose, e.g. authentication.
Substatements include information of
individual peers.
Possible substatement is as follows.
.\"
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic (peer \(ba client) Ar host
.Op Ic interface Ar interface
.Op Ic no synchronization
.Op Ic nexthopself
.Op Ic lcladdr Ar localaddress
.Ic ;
.Xc
Specifies the IPv6 address of an individual IBGP peer.
If the peer is specified with the keyword
.Ic client,
bgpd will treat it as a route reflector client.
Otherwise, the peer
will be treated as a normal IBGP peer.
The interface on which the peer exists may also be specified.
Interface
specification may be necessary when the peer address is a link-local
address.
If the optional keyword
.Ic no synchronization
is specified and bgpd act as a route reflector for the peer,
it will reflect each IBGP route without waiting for synchronization with
RIPng for the route.
If the optional keyword
.Ic nexthopself
is specified,
.Nm bgpd
puts its own address to the next hop field of
an MP_REACH_NLRI attributes when advertising a new route to the peer.
.Ic lcladdr
and
.Ar filters
can be specified for an IBGP peer as well as for an EBGP peer.
The semantics of the keyrwords are same as ones for an EBGP peer.
.El
.\"
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic export proto bgp as Ar as_number
.Ic { Ar export_list
.Ic };
.Xc
Controls exportation to EBGP.
.Ar as_number,
the autonomous system number of the EBGP peer, must be specified.
The peer AS has to be defined by a
.Ic group type external peeras
substatement of the
.Ic bgp
statement somewhere before the
.Ic export
statement.
The
.Ar as_number
may not be the AS number to which the bgpd itself belongs.
.Pp
The export list specifies export based on the origin of a route and
the syntax varies depending on the source.
Followings are the possible elements of the list.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic proto direct interface Ar interface
.Ic {all;};
.Xc
Routes to directly attached interfaces.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic proto bgp as Ar as_number
.Ic {all;};
.Xc
Routes advertised by the EBGP peer specified by the
.Ar as_number .
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic proto rip {all;};
.Xc
Routes advertised via RIPng.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic proto ibgp {all;};
.Xc
Routes advertised via IBGP.
.El
.El
.Sh The RIPng Related Statements
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic rip (yes \(ba no) { Ar substatements
.Ic };
.Xc
Enables or disables RIPng.
By default RIPng is disabled.
Possible substatements are as follows.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic interface Ar interface Op Ar attributes...
.Ic ;
.Xc
Controls various attributes of sending or receiving RIP on specific
interfaces.
Multiple attributes can be specified in a single
.Ic rip
statement.
.Pp
The followings are the list of attributes.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic noripin
Specifies that RIP packets received via the specified interface will
be ignored.
The default is to listen to RIP packets on all
non-loopback interfaces.
.\"
.It Ic noripout
Specifies that no RIP packets will be sent on the specified
interfaces.
The default is to send RIP on all interfaces.
.\"
.It Ic default originate
Specifies to advertise the RIPng default route with metric 1 on the interface.
If this attribute is specified, the incoming default route on the interface
will be ignored.
.\"
.It Ic metricin Ar metric
Specifies metric which is added to any incoming RIPng routes
before route calculation.
Its value must be no less than 1 and
no greater than 16.
.El
.\"
.It Ic sitelocal (yes \(ba no);
Specifies whether or not site-local prefixes should be accepted and
advertised via RIPng.
If
.Ic yes
is specified, all site-local prefixes will be accepted and advertised
on all RIPng available interfaces unless a specific filter will filter
them.
If
.Ic no
is specified, any site-local prefixes will never be accepted nor
advertised on any RIPng available interfaces despite of other specific
filters.
Note that
.Nm bgpd
does not care about site boundary.
When it receives a site-local
prefix on an interface and if it should be accepted by this statement,
the prefix will be automatically advertised on all other interfaces,
even if the receiving node is a site boundary.
For this reason, site-local addresses are not allowed by default.
.El
.\"
.Sh The Route Aggregation Statements
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic aggregate Ar prefix
.Ic { Ar substatements
.Ic };
.Xc
.Pp
Specifies route aggregation.
Routes that match the specified prefix
will be advertised in the aggregated form.
That is, only the specified
prefix will be advertised instead of each specific prefix.
.Pp
There are two type of substatements that can be appeared in an
.Ic aggregate
statement.
One is specification of interfaces on which aggregated
routes are advertised, and the other is to describe routes that
should not be aggregated.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic proto direct interface Ar interface
.Ic {all;};
.Xc
The
.Ar substatement
specifies interfaces to advertise aggregated route.
By default, bgpd doesn't advertise aggregated routes on any interface
even if there is an
.Ic aggregate
statement.
To advertise aggregated routes, you should explicitly
specify the interface by this
.Ar substatement .
.It Xo
.Ic explicit { Ar prefix_1; prefix_2; ..., prefix_N;
.Ic };
.Xc
Exception to the aggregation can be specified as a list.
Prefixes in the list will be advertised even if they match the prefix
specified in the
.Ic aggregate
statement.
.Pp
In this list, each prefix is specified in the same form of the
.Ic filterin
statement.
