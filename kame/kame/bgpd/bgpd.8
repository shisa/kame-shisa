.Sh NAME
.Nm bgpd
.Nd BGP4+ and RIPng routing protocol daemon
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Op Fl C
.Op Fl f
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
speaks IPv6 routing protocols,
and maintains the IPv6 network routing table.
Though the name is
.Nm bgpd ,
it supports both BGP4+ (RFC\ 2283)
and RIPng (RFC\ 2080) as IPv6 routing protocols.
.Pp
Options supported by
.Nm bgpd :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar configfile
Specify alternate location,
.Ar configfile ,
for configuration file.
By default,
.Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/bgpd.conf
is used.
.It Fl C
Just check the configuration and immediately exit.
When
.Nm
is invoked with this option, super user privilege is not required.
.It Fl f
Do not become daemon, run in foreground.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
program dumps its current routing information to a dump file when
it receives a SIGUSR1 signal.
The information includes per-interface
RIPng routes and per-peer base BGP information.
By default, the dump file is
.Ar /var/run/bgpd.dump ,
which is configurable in the configuration file.
If the dump file does not exist,
.Nm
will create a new one and dump to it.
.\"
.Sh "ERROR MESSAGES"
The
.Nm
daemon logs error messages using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.\"
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/inetd.pid -compact
.It Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/bgpd.conf
default configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/bgpd.pid
the pid of the currently running
.Nm bgpd .
.It Pa /var/run/bgpd.dump
default dump file.
.El
.\"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bgpd.conf 5
.\"
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command was first appeared in Toshiba IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
No authentication is supported.
Therfore, OPEN message's optional parameter always consists of nothing.
.Pp
Currently, the
.Nm
daemon doesn't watch the routing socket.
So after invoking,
.Nm
can't handle new routes which are manually added or are added
by some other routing daemons/commands.
.Pp
There is code to handle OSPFv6 in the
.Nm
source directory, but OSPFv6 support is just in progress.
.Nm
is not able to distribute nor get IPv6 routing information via OSPFv6.
