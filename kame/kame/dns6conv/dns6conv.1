.Nm dns6conv
.Nd convert an IPv6 textual address for a DNS RR
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b Ar beginbit
.Op Fl e Ar endbit
.Op Fl f Ar formattype
.Ar IPv6address
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
converts a specified textual IPv6 address into an appropriate DNS
resource record format.
It first separates a portion of the given address from the
.Ar beginbit
bit to the
.Ar endbit
bit, with
.Ar beginbit
inclusive and
.Ar endbit
exclusive
.Pq the 0th bit is the most significant .
The default values of theses bits are 64 and 128,
and can be specified by the
.Fl b
and
.Fl e
command line options, respectively.
When specified, the values must be between 0 and 128, with these two
values inclusive.
Also,
.Ar beginbit
must be smaller than
.Ar endbit .
.Pp
Then the command prints the separated address in an appropriate format
to be used as
.Pq a part of
a DNS resource record.
The
.Fl f
option is used to specify the type of the desired resource record.
The following values can be specified with the option.
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ic nibble
specifies to print the address as nibble DNS labels.
This is the default format type of this command.
When this format is specified,
.Ar beginbit
and
.Ar endbit
must be a multiple of 4.
.It Ic a6
specifies to print the separated address as an ordinary IPv6 textual
format, which can be used as the address suffix part of an A6 resource
record.
.It Ic bit
specifies to print the address as a hex string with the length of the
significant bits separated by the slash character.
The output can be used as a bitstring label to construct reverse map
database.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
exits with 0 on success, and non-zero on errors.
.\"
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in the WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
