.Os KAME
.Sh NAME
.Nm hroute6d.conf
.Nd configuration file for
.Xr hroute6d 8 .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm hroute6d.conf
configuration file consists of a sequence of statements terminated 
by a newline. Statements are composed of tokens seperated by white 
spaces, which can be any combination of blanks and tabs. Comments 
begin with a
.Nm #
sign and runs to the end of line.
.Pp
Configuration file consists of three parts. They are 
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Global Configuration Part
.It
Route Configuration Part 
.It
Interface Configuration Part
.El
and appear in this order on the configuration file.
.Pp
Each part have their own set of statements. In general, the order of 
statements are free and any number of statements may be specified. A
statement begins with a command and followed by some parameters.
.Pp
.Nm hroute6d.conf
must be present in the directory
.Pa /usr/local/v6/etc
before starting 
.Xr hroute6d 8
daemon.
.Sh Common Parameter Syntax
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar metric   
metric value between 1 and 16 (decimal) inclusive.
.It Ar on/off   
character string
.Ar on
or
.Ar off .
.\"
.It Ar prefix   
character string 
.Ar default
or pair of an
.Ar address
and a
.Ar prefix-length .
.\"
.It Ar address   
IPv6 address in text representation as defined in RFC 1884.

.It Ar prefix-length    
numerical value between 0 and 128 (decimal) inclusive.
.El
.\"
.Sh Global Configuration Part
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic quiet
The hroute6d only listen to the advertisements of others and
never advertise it's routing information to neighbours. If 
this option is not specified, hroute6d send own routing information 
to neighbours. 
.Nm quiet
is NOT the default.
.\"
.It Ic poison
.It Ic horizon
.It Ic nohorizon
Specifies which method to use.
.Nm posion
means do posion reverse,
.Nm horizon 
means do split horizon (but not posion reverse) and
.Nm nohorizon
means do not split horizon. The default method is 
.Nm poison
.\"
.It Ic trace Ar on/off
Enables/Disables packet tracing. The default is 
.Ar off 
.\"
.It Ic defaultmetric Ar metric
Set the default value for the metric. If not specified,
the value is 1.
.\"
.It Ic headerlen Ar headerlength
Set the total length of the IPv6 header and UDP header in
octets (decimal). Used when the hroute6d calculate the maximum number of 
RTEs in one message. The default value is 48.
.\"
.It Ic "nexthop out"
Always put a next hop RTE in any outgoing messages. If not
specified, the hroute6d make messages without next hop
RTE when the next hop is itself (default case).
.\"
.It Ic "nexthop noin"
Ignore the next hop RTE in any incoming messages and treat
the neighbour which sends the message as next hop. This is not
the default.
.\"
.It Ic routetag Ar tagvalue
Use this value (in hexadecimal) in the route tag field of each RTE which is
made by this hroute6d (i.e direct attached networks). Valid values
are from 0000 to FFFF in hexadecimal. The default value is 0.
.\"
.It Ic compatible
Advertises and accepts routes for IPv4 compatible addresses.
This is NOT the default.
.El
.\"
.Sh Route Configuration Part
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Ic static Ar prefix Ar address Ar interface
.Op Ic metric Ar metric 
.Op Ic routetag Ar tagvalue
.Xc
Make a static route.
.Ar prefix
is the destination prefix.
.Ar interface
is the interface name (like
.Ar lo0
) which attaches the network next hop gateway belongs to.
.Ar address
is the next hop gateway address. Metric
of the static route can be specified.  If not specified,
the value which is specified by the 
.Ic defaultmetric
statement (see previous section) is used. The route tag can be 
specified too. The default route tag is specified by
.Ic routetag
statement (see previous section). To set a default route, use
.Ar default 
as prefix.
.\"
.It Ic ignore Ar prefix
Ignore any RTE matches this prefix in any incoming messages. If 
prefix is 
.Ar default
ignore only the default route RTE (not all RTEs).
.El
.\"
.Sh Interface Configuration Part
In this part, settings per interface are defined as interface by 
interface manner. Each interface setting begins with
.Ic interface 
statement and ends before next
.Ic interface 
statement or the end of file.
The default setting of any of interface not described in Interface
Configuration Part is 
.Ic in ,
.Ic out .
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic interface Ar interfacename
The interfacename is the character strings in the form of "name 
unit", such as 
.Ar lo0 ,
.Ar de1 .
.\"
.It Ic poision
.It Ic horizon
.It Ic nohorizon
Specifies which method to use in creating messages which is sent on
this interface. This statement overrides default method specified in
the General Configuration Part.
.\"
.It Ic in Op Ar address
Enable the hroute6d to listen advertisements on this interface.
If
.Ar address
is omitted, all advertisements are received and
processed. If
.Ar address
specified, only messages from the
.Ar address
is received and messages from others are ignored. The default is 
.Ic in
with no parameters. Note:
.Ar address
should be link-local address.
.\"
.It Ic noin Op Ar address
Disable the hroute6d to listen advertisements on this interface. If
address parameter is omitted, all advertisements received from this
interface is ignored. Both 
.Ic noin
and
.Ic in
statements may be used on the same interface. In that case, latter 
statements overrides former ones. For example,
.Ic in
and
.Ic noin Ar gateway1
appear in this order, the hroute6d accpets all messages from the
interface except the ones from the gateway1.
.\"
.It Ic out Op Ar address
Enable hroute6d to advertise it's own routing information to 
neighbours on this interface. If 
.Ar address
parameter is omitted, advertisements are multicasted to
.Ad FF02::9
(as defined in RFC). If
.Ar address
is specified, advertisements are unicasted to the address. If
multiple 
.Ic out
statements are specified, advertisements are sent to each 
.Ic address
specified. For example, 
.Ic out
, 
.Ic out Ar gateway1
and
.Ic out Ar gateway2
appear in this order, advertisements are sent to 
.Ad FF02::9 ,
.Ar gateway1
(unicast) and
.Ar gateway2
(unicast). The default is 
.Ic out
with no parameters.
.Ar address
should be a link-local address.
.\"
.It Ic noout
Disable the hroute6d to advertise it's own routing information to 
neighbours on this interface. This is not the default.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic aggregate Ar prefix
.Op Ic metric Ar metric
.Op Ic routetag Ar tagvalue
.Xc
Every route that matches 
.Ar prefix
are aggregated to one RTE with 
.Ar prefix
when advertise on this interface.
For aggregated prefix, a routing table entry toward loopback interface with
.Dv RTF_REJECT
will be installed, so that there will be no bogus packet loop.
Metric can be specified.
If no metric is specified, aggregated RTE use the default metric.
Also, route tag can be specified. 
.\"
.It Ic nosite
Define this interface does not belong to any site. The hroute6d 
should not accpet RTE with site-local address from this interface
and should not advertise any RTE with site-local addresses. This is
the default
.\"
.It Ic site
Define that this interface belongs to a site. Accept RTEs with
site-local addresses from this interface. Advertise RTEs with site-local
addresses.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic gendefault
.Op Ic metric Ar metric
.Op Ic routetag Ar tagvalue
.Xc
Make a default route RTE (i.e prefix length = 0) in the message 
advertised on this interface. Metric and/or routetag can be specified.
When this command is specified, messages from this interface contain
ONLY default route RTE.  This is not the default.
.\"
.It Xo
.Ic filter Ar prefix
.Op Ic routetag Ar tagvalue
.Xc
Ignore any RTEs that matches prefix from this interface. If 
.Ar prefix 
is 
.Ar default
ignore only the default route RTE (not all RTEs). If route tag
value is specified, ignore any RTEs that matches both
.Ar prefix 
and
.Ar tagvalue 
from this interface.
.\"
.It Ic metricin Ar metric
The value
.Ar metric 
is added to any incoming RTEs metrics (from this interface) before
route calculation. The default is to use default metric specified 
by 
.Ic defaultmetric .
.\"
.It Ic metricout Ar metric
The value
.Ar metric
is added to any outgoing (from this interface) RTEs' metrics. This
does not affect route calculation of this hroute6d (affect only
neighbours).
.\"
.It Ic nexthop Ar prefix Ar address
Include next hop RTE of
.Ar address
to advertise the
.Ar prefix
route.
.\"
.It Ic propagate
Propagate default route entry which hroute6d learned from neighbours.
.El
.\"
.Sh Sample Configuration 
If
.Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/hroute6d.conf
is empty file, hroute6d become active on all interfaces which have
at least one IPv6 address.
