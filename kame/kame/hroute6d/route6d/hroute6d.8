.Sh NAME
.Nm hroute6d
.Nd network routing daemon for IPv6 networks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm hroute6d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Hroute6d
is invoked at boot time to manage the network routing tables.
The routing daemon is a variant of routing daemon for IPv4 
networks and uses a variant of the Xerox NS Routing Information 
Protocol in maintaining up to date kernel routing table entries.
It reads the configuration information from a configuration file
(see
.Xr hroute6d.conf 5 ).
.Pp
.Nm hroute6d
listens on the
.Xr udp 4
socket for the routing information packets.  If the host is an
internetwork router, it periodically supplies copies
of its routing tables to any directly connected hosts
and networks. The daemon can be administrated by a utility
.Xr rip6admin 8 .
Another utility 
.Xr rip6query 8
can be used to get all or some routes known by a RIPng router.
.Pp
When
.Nm hroute6d
is started, it uses the
.Xr sysctl 3
to find those
directly connected interfaces configured with IPv6 addresses into the
system and marked ``up'' (the loopback interface
is ignored).
.Nm Hroute6d
then transmits a 
.Em request
packet on each interface (using a multicast packet if
the interface supports it) and enters a loop, listening
for
.Em request
and
.Em response
packets from other hosts.
.Pp
When a
.Em request
packet is received, 
.Nm hroute6d
formulates a reply based on the information maintained in its
internal tables.  The
.Em response
packet generated contains a list of known routes, each marked
with a ``hop count'' metric (a count of 16, or greater, is
considered ``infinite'').  The metric associated with each
route returned provides a metric
.Em relative to the sender .
.Pp
.Em Response
packets received by
.Nm hroute6d
are used to update the routing tables if one of the following
conditions is satisfied:
.Bl -enum
.It
No routing table entry exists for the destination network
or host, and the metric indicates the destination is ``reachable''
(i.e. the hop count is not infinite).
.It
The source host of the packet is the same as the router in the
existing routing table entry.  That is, updated information is
being received from the very internetwork router through which
packets for the destination are being routed.
.It
The existing entry in the routing table has not been updated for
some time (defined to be 90 seconds) and the route is at least
as cost effective as the current route.
.It
The new route describes a shorter route to the destination than
the one currently stored in the routing tables; the metric of
the new route is compared against the one stored in the table
to decide this.
.El
.Pp
When an update is applied,
.Nm hroute6d
records the change in its internal tables and updates the kernel
routing table.
The change is reflected in the next
.Em response
packet sent.
.Pp
In addition to processing incoming packets,
.Nm hroute6d
also periodically checks the routing table entries.
If an entry has not been updated for 3 minutes, the entry's metric
is set to infinity and marked for deletion.  Deletions are delayed
an additional 120 seconds to insure the invalidation is propagated
throughout the local internet.
.Pp
Hosts acting as internetwork routers gratuitously supply their
routing tables every 30 (+/- 15) seconds to all directly connected hosts
and networks.
The response is sent to the all router multicast address on attached interfaces.
If no response is received on an interface, another route may be chosen
to route around the interface, or the route may be dropped if no alternative
is available.
