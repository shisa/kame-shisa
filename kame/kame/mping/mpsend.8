.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is designed for measure multicast routing stability in IPv6
network used with
.Xr mprecv 8
program.
The
.Nm
sends UDP packets to the multicast destination
.Ar mcastaddr
using
.Ar interface
in daemon mode.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl c Ar count
Specify the number of packet to be sent before the 
.Nm
terminates.
By default, the
.Nm
sends packets infinitely.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Specify the name of
.Ar interface
for listening to multicast stream.
If unicast address is specified with
.Fl m ,
the option has no effect.
.It Fl l Ar hop_limit
Specify the hop_limit value of the packets.
Default value is 1.
.It Fl m Ar mcastaddr
Specify multicast adddress to be used.
.Fl m
is mandatory.
.It Fl p Ar port
Specify the UDP port number.
Default value is 9998.
.It Fl s Ar size
Specify the packet payload size in byte.
IPv6/UDP headers are not
included.
Default value is 128 and minimum value is 16.
.It Fl t Ar interval
Specify the interval of packets in second.
Default value is 10.
Note this value can be a floating point value, such as 0.1sec.
Only the super user can specify smaller value than 1sec.
.It Fl v
Enable the debug output and prevent the
.Nm
go into daemon mode.
.El
.\"
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
exit if
.Ar count
is specified and
.Ar count
packets are sent.
.\"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mprecv 8
.\"
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME Ipv6 protocol stack kit.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
IPv4 is not supported.
.Pp
The format of logfile may not be not readable.
