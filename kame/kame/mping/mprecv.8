.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is designed for measure multicast routing stability in IPv6
network used with
.Xr mpsend 8
program.
The
.Nm
receives UDP packets sent to multicast address
.Ar mcastaddr
using
.Ar interface .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d
Specify the
.Nm
to run in daemon mode.
.It Fl p Ar port
Specify the UDP port number.
Default value is 9998.
.It Fl D Ar dumpfile
Specify the name of dumpfile.
By default
.Pa /tmp/mprecv.dump
is used.
.It Fl H Ar history
Specify the number of "packet lost" history kept for each logging
interval.
.It Fl i Ar interface
Specify the name of
.Ar interface
for listening to multicast stream.
If unicast address is specified with
.Fl m ,
or
.Fl m
is omitted, the option has no effect.
.It Fl L Ar logfile
Specify the name of logfile.
By default
.Pa /var/log/mprecv.log
is used.
.It Fl m Ar mcastaddr
Specify multicast adddress to listen to.
If
.Fl m
is not specified,
.Nm
will listen to wildcard IPv6 address
.Pq Li :: .
.It Fl T Ar loginterval
Specify the interval of status dump to
.Ar logfile
in second.
The default value is 3600 sec (1 hour).
.It Fl X Ar expire
Specify the expire time in day to delete idle session records.
Default value is 7 days.
.It Fl v
Enable the debug output and prevent the
.Nm
go into daemon mode.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
program also writes status dump to
.Ar dumpfile
when it receives a SIGINFO signal.
SIGWINCH signal reset the interval measuring variables.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack kit.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
IPv4 is not supported.
