.Sh NAME
.Nm inet6d
.Nd super-daemon for IPv6 tcp/udp services
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl R Ar rate
.Op Ar config-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is IPv6 variant of
.Xr inetd 8 .
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable debugging facility by setting
.Dv SO_DEBUG
socket option.
.It Fl R Ar rate
.Nm
implements prevention mechanism for denial-of-service attack.
By default,
.Nm
forks no more than 40 servers per a service.
.Fl R
gives a way to modify the number of simultaneous fork operations
allowed for a service.
.It Ar config-file
Alternate location to find the config file.
.El
.Ss IPsec
The implementation includes tiny hack to support IPsec policy setting for
each of the socket.
A special form of comment line, starting with
.Dq Li "#@" ,
will work as policy specifier.
The content of the above comment line will be treated as IPsec policy string,
as described in
.Xr ipsec_set_policy 3 .
A
.Li "#@"
line will affect all the following lines in
.Pa inet6d.conf ,
so you may want to reset IPsec policy by using a comment line with
.Li "#@"
only
.Pq with no policy string .
.Pp
If invalid IPsec policy string appears on
.Pa inet6d.conf ,
.Nm
will leave error message using
.Xr syslog 3 ,
and terminates itself.
.Ss FAITH support
.Nm
has a support for 
.Xr faith 4
and
.Xr faithd 8 .
If
.Dq Li tcp/faith
is specified as the protocol
.Pq instead of Dq Li tcp ,
the socket will be marked for use with
.Xr faithd 8 ,
and
.Xr setsockopt 2
will be issued with
.Dv IPV6_FAITH .
See 
.Xr faith 4
for details.
.\" .Sh RETURN VALUES
.\" (to be written)
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/local/v6/etc/inet6d.conf -compact
.It Pa /usr/local/v6/etc/inet6d.conf
The default configuration file.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr inetd 8 ,
.Xr inetd.conf 5 ,
.Xr services 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in WIDE Hydrangea IPv6 protocol stack kit.
IPsec hack was made by KAME project, in 1999.
