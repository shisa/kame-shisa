You'll need to follow the steps below.  They can be separated into two major
sections - kernel build and userland build.

Be sure to perform "tree preparation" procedure, described in
../INSTALL, prior to taking the steps below.


A. Backup
=========
The following procedure replaces, or overwrites, the following
files/directories:
	/bsd
	/usr/include
	some of boot-loader related files, such as those in /usr/mdec
so you may want to back them up before going through the steps.

A-1. Backup your kernel file, if you need to.
	# cp /bsd /bsd.previous

A-2. Backup /usr/include directory, if you want an untouched tree to be
   preserved somewhere.
	# cd /usr
	# mkdir include.clean
	# cd include.clean
	# (cd ../include; tar Bpcf - . ) | tar Bpxf -


B. Kernel build
===============
Consult OpenBSD documentations for more detail.

B-0. It is assumed that you are in platform-specific directory (kame/openbsd).
     If you are not, chdir to there.

B-1. Go down to sys/arch/ARCH/conf.
	% cd sys/arch/ARCH/conf

B-2. Make a kernel configuration file, and invoke "config CONFIGFILE".
     GENERIC.KAME should have commonly used IPv6 definitions, so you may want
     to copy the file to begin with.
	% cp GENERIC.KAME CONFIGFILE
	% vi CONFIGFILE
	% /usr/sbin/config CONFIGFILE

B-3. Build the kernel.  The process will make kernel file named "netbsd".
	% cd ../compile/CONFIGFILE
	% make depend
	% make

B-4. Copy the kernel file to root directory, as root.
	# cp bsd /


C. Userland build
=================
C-0. It is assumed that you are in platform-specific directory (kame/openbsd).
     If you are not, chdir to there.

C-1. Invoke "make includes" as root.  This will populate KAME-ready include
     files into /usr/include.
	# make includes

C-2. As normal user (or root, if you prefer) perform "make".
	% make

C-3. As root, perform "make install".  This will install necessary userland
     tools into /usr/local/v6/{bin,sbin,whatever}.  This should not replace
     existing IPv4-only userland tools, so it is safe.
	# make install


D. Reboot
=========
D-1. Reboot with the command you like.
	# reboot


E. Configurations, in short
===========================
E-1. Most of configuration files are shipped with normal OS distribution,
     and are in located in /etc.  If you need special configuration file for
     KAME-origin daemons, configuration files need to be placed in
     /usr/local/v6/etc.  You may want to copy /usr/local/v6/etc/foo.sample into
     /usr/local/v6/etc/foo, and edit as necessary.

E-2. Commands modified by KAME project are placed in /usr/local/v6/{bin,sbin}.
     For daily use, you will need to add both of (or either of) them
     into your command search path (consult manpage for your favorite
     shell).  Make sure to make them used before /usr/bin or /usr/sbin,
     otherwise you end up using OS-supplied (hence not IPv6 nor IPsec capable)
     commands.

E-3. There are batch of documents installed into /usr/local/v6/man
     and /usr/local/v6/share/doc.  Please read them as necessary.
     If you wish to develop your own programs, we suggest you to read through
     supplied documents, RFCs, and other documents to learn how.
