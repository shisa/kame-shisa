Installation procedure - grabbing tree via anoncvs

You can grab the latest KAME tree via anonymous cvs (anoncvs).

Note that KAME/BSDI3 and KAME/BSDI4 are inaccessible via anoncvs,
due to license restriction (BSDI is commercial product and we cannot
redistribute BSDI-copyrighted source to non-licensee).

Here's how you can checkout the latest tree:

A-1. Install CVS onto your client.

A-2. Logon to KAME anonymous CVS.
	% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.kame.net:/cvsroot/kame login
     Password is "anoncvs" (doublequote is not the part of password).

     The password will be cached into ~/.cvspass, so you need to login only
     once from single machine.

A-3. Checkout the tree (replace $somewhere with your working directory).
	% cd $somewhere
	% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.kame.net:/cvsroot/kame co -P kame

     If you are interested in some specific platform only, alternatively
     you can do the following, but not recommended:
	% cd $somewhere
	% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.kame.net:/cvsroot/kame co -P \
		kame/Makefile kame/Makefile.inc
	% cd kame
	% make TARGET=netbsd tree

A-4. Follow the document placed in $somewhere/kame/INSTALL.

Here's how you can update the source code tree to the latest:

B-1. Go into top directory and perform "make update-all".
	% cd $somewhere/kame
	% make update-all

     If you are interested only to specific platform, you can do "update"
     instead of "update-all".
	% cd $somewhere/kame
	% make TARGET=netbsd update

SNAP kit is generated by packaging a tree checked out by anoncvs.
You can update your tree to the latest by doing A-1, A-2 then B-1.
SNAP users are supposed to be hackers so I'm sure you want to synchronize
to the latest :-)
